This is a guide to help you figure out what to write. Having a template is fine
if you know exactly what fills in each section but what if you don't?

Steps
=====

1. Write down all the problems. Avoid writing any solutions or orienting the
   problems in terms of solutions. E.g. "users of the website need to be able
   to see a preview of what they are going to buy.", not "users or the website
   need to be able to add items to a cart."

2. Determine the scope of what the feature will solve. What should it do? More
   importantly, what _shouldn't_ it do? E.g. "Only going to solve the
   show-preview integration part. Collecting the info is something else." For
   any problems that are out of scope, give an idea of where they should be
   solved and how that place relates to the feature. "The cart will collect the
   items."

3. Define your terms. Think about boundaries and relationships and give them
   names. These can change in the future, so just give them the most
   descriptive of names.  They can be abstracted or generalized later. Don't
   worry about any grand metaphor that may limit thinking. For instance,
   starting with a shopping cart metaphor suggests items and quantities, maybe
   a paste-board of related wishes is a better fit.

4. So far you haven't really touched on a solution and that's good. Think about
   what existing components would be affected by _any_ solution. How might a
   solution be isolated from them? This will help you start to define your
   boundaries.

5. At this point the solution you've had in your head all along probably has
   distinct modules, interface points and descriptive names. If not, go over
   the first few steps again and see if you missed anything. Explain them by a
   friend or coworker or a rubber duck, that usually does it.

6. What can you represent as a diagram? Pictures are easy to digest and convey
   a lot of information. They also help break up a document.

7. Now start working your way through the template. If any part feels hard to
   write go back to your list of problems and think about how your solution is
   specifically addressing them.
